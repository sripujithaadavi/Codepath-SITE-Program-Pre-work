## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
    * I got the complete information from  Codepath. So no additional resources were used to complete this SITE program pre-work.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    * I din't feel like I've faced major obstacles as I'm having a good time with it. For me, the main difficulty is implementing the game logic within the guess() function as I thought not to look at the answer and instead execute it on my own.
    * Usually I will complete all my work on time. But this time I came to know about this program a day before the deadline so I submitted this project on the day of deadline.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    * I want to learn to create a dynamic webpage that incorporates requesting external data from the internet and storing it in a database.
    * I want to know the entire workflow and procedure for working on a standard web project as a group

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    * I will add options like multiple player, single player where a player can choose multiple player if he/she is playing with their friends. Everyone like to play with thier friends, I think this makes game more interesting
    * Implementing a point system, where player will get a point after he selects correct pattern.
    * Single players who are bored at home can also participate in this game using single player option.
    * Players can select their favourite song and and the system will generate sounds that resembles the music of that song. These type of features makes players to learn how to play music with buttons and they will enjoy alot.
